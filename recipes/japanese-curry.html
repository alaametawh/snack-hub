        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Japanese curry is a classic homemade comfort food, often featured in romance anime. It's also a beloved traditional dish in Japan — and always tastes better when it's made with love.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 ¾ pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>3 onions, quartered</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
            <li>4 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cube chicken bouillon (Optional)</li>
            <li>3 medium potatoes, cut into 3-inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 ½ (3.5 ounce) containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
            <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>NOTE :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use any beef stew meat you prefer.</li>
            <li>Substitute soy sauce for the Worcestershire if desired.</li>
            <li>Curry roux is found in boxes in the international aisle or an international grocery store. There are many brands with varying heat levels. I like S&B and Vermont Curry. I usually mix the two brands. The more roux you use the thicker the sauce.</li>
            <li>As with most stews, the longer you simmer the better it will taste. This can also be frozen without the potatoes.</li>
        </ul>
